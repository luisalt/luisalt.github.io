                <h2>The Rivers and the Sea</h2>
                <p>Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt. &ldquo;When we come to you,&rdquo; said they to the Sea, &ldquo;we are sweet and drinkable: but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own.&rdquo; The Sea replied shortly, &ldquo;Keep away from me and you&rsquo;ll remain sweet.&rdquo;</p>
