<p>I am the founder of Livework in Brazil - a global innovation and service design studio - and EISE - the first School of Service Design in the world. I've also created the first Design Thinking course in Latin America at renowned business school ESPM, and I also teach at Transdisciplinary Design Master at Parsons in New York City and at a post-graduate MBA at FAAP in São Paulo. I am the author of Design Thinking Brasil, a best-selling book published by Campus-Elsevier and of the upcoming "Servir Bem para Servir Sempre", a book about the importance of serving for both large and small businesses and how to do it. I speak at events globally in portuguese, spanish and english about Service Design, Design Thinking, Innovation Metrics and High-Performance Cultures. </p>
